# Ultimate React Boilerplate

## What is it?

I’m a React Typescript boilerplate with a WIP backend baked in (thanks to Supabase) 😛 Set up your next project/prototype with minimal input, so you can do what you do best, build and test amazing new products 🔥

You can see me in action [here](https://ultimate-react-boilerplate.netlify.app/).

## What's in the box?

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [jotai](https://jotai.org/) for state 👻
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling 💅
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development ⚡️
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent formatting 🎨
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting 🕵️‍♂️
- [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for integration testing 🐙
- staged linting, thanks to [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) 🚫💩
- [@fontsource](https://fontsource.org/) for custom fonts ✍️

## Setup

OBVIOUS NOTE: Replace "PROJECT_NAME" with your own project's name 😉

```
git clone https://github.com/shaunsaker/ultimate-react-boilerplate.git PROJECT_NAME
cd PROJECT_NAME
yarn
```

## Running

```
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

I'd recommend using [Netlify](netlify.com) for deployment and connecting the site to your Github repo so that new deploys are triggered on every push to `master`.
